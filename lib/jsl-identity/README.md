# JumpstartLab Identity

Client to consume an api and return user identity data for JumpstartLab.
Currently used by [register for class](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/register_for_class)
to consume identity data out of [asquared](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/asquared).
Eventually, identity data will hopefully be extracted into its own application.

This app is tested by plugging it into asquared and showing that it actually works.
This is to prevent divergence between the client and the api it is consuming.
